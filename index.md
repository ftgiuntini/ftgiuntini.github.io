# Felipe T. Giuntini

## Welcome

Welcome to my page! I try to make available here in a slightly more organized way the experimental codes involved in my research of social data data analysis, but also provide some codes that I develop for personal learning, for example, something I did. Well, it's not a rule, lol.
